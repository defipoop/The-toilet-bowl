# Agent Operating Loop

Daily Loop:

1. Propose 3 build quests.
2. Wait for approval in Discord.
3. After approval:
   - Create a new branch.
   - Implement the feature.
   - Keep scope SMALL.
   - Commit changes.
   - Open a Pull Request.
4. Post PR summary in Discord.

Rules:
- Never push directly to main.
- One quest at a time.
- Prefer small playable or viewable outputs.
- If unclear, ask for clarification.
